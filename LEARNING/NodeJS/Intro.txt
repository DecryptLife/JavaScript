What is Node.js?
 - Node allows us to run javascript on the server or directly on the system as well. We 
 can run the javascript files on the browser using V8 enginer which compiles JS into machine
 code during runtime. This V8 engine is also wrapped inside the Node and Node is written in C++
 so it can be run on the computer as well. 

 Node features:
 - Read and write files on a computer
 - Connect to a database
 - Acts as a server for content

Advantages
- No need to learn an extra language for server
- Can share code between front and back end
- Node.js has massive community behind it
- Huge amount of third-party packages & tools to help

Global Object
- It is already available and methods need not be preceded by the Object
        - setTimeout displays the result after a delay of time that has been setTimeout
        - setInterval will keep displaying the result after each interval


__dirname => this gives the absolute path of the folder this file is in
__filename => this gives the absolute path of the folder this file is in along with the __filename


File system
-  import the object " require('fs') "
-  fs.read(path_string, async function) - the async function is executed only after the file is read
