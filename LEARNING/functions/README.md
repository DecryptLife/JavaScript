calcAge1 => function declaration
calcAge2 => function expression

before it is defined does not work and produces an error.

When to use function declaration or expression?

It doesn't matter it is personal choice but it is a good practice to learn, understand and practice them.

Arrow function -> implicit return call when we have one liner function otherwise we have to use explicit return
